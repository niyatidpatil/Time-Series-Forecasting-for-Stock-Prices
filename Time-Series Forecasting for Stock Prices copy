Time-Series Forecasting for Stock Prices
CS-675 Introduction to Data Science - FALL 2023


Abstract:
This report presents an analysis of a dataset containing stock prices from June 29, 2010, to December 1, 2023. The data consists of various features such as Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits. The goal is to use machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), and Prophet, to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

Introduction:
Stock price forecasting is a crucial task in financial analysis, enabling investors and traders to make informed decisions. This report explores the application of different machine learning models to predict stock prices and provides insights into their performance.

Problem Statement:
The challenge is to develop accurate and reliable models capable of forecasting future stock prices, considering the dynamic and unpredictable nature of financial markets.

Source of Data:
The dataset used in this analysis contains stock prices from 2010-06-29 to 2023-12-15. It includes features like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits. The data is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

Data Preparation:
The dataset is prepared by analyzing the date range, handling null values, and exploring basic statistics. A subset of the data from 2019-09-03 to 2023-12-15 is extracted for model training and testing.

Analyzing Data Using Visualization:
Exploratory data analysis involves visualizing the data to understand patterns, trends, and outliers. Box Plots, histograms, and scatter plots provide insights into the distribution and characteristics of the stock prices.

Observations:
- The dataset shows a right-skewed distribution.
- Outliers in stock prices can significantly impact model training.
- The histogram indicates most closures occur within a specific range.
- The scatter plot highlights a prominent range from 2010 to 2020.

Training a Model:
The dataset is split into training and test sets, and a time-series forecasting approach is adopted. Features (F1, F2, F3) and a dependent variable (Y) are used to capture temporal dependencies. LSTM models are trained with historical data. ARIMA, and Prophet models are also used to predict the future values.

Evaluating Model:
  - LSTM Model Evaluation:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 210.7785
  - The model captures underlying patterns but shows discrepancies in later periods.

  - ARIMA Model Evaluation:
  - Captures upward trend and short-term fluctuations.
  - Shows some discrepancies in recent predictions.

  - Prophet Model Evaluation:
  - Provides forecasts with trends, seasonality, and confidence intervals.
  - Performance metrics include MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE, MdAPE, SMAPE, and coverage.

Conclusion:

The analysis suggests that the LSTM, ARIMA, and Prophet models are suitable for stock price forecasting, with each having its strengths and limitations. The choice of model depends on factors such as dataset size, complexity, and interpretability. It's crucial to consider the dynamic nature of financial markets and continuously refine models based on new data.

In summary, while the models show promising results, users should exercise caution and combine forecasting results with other financial analyses for informed decision-making. Future work could involve refining models, incorporating additional features, and exploring ensemble techniques for improved accuracy.
